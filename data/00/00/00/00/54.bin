把枪放下  否则我不客气了
Put it down before I make you.

282
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,300
你先放下
You put yours down.

283
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,310
别绊倒了
Watch your step.

284
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,930
别动  别动
Stay down. Stay down.

285
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,110
别动了
Stay down.

286
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,450
{\an2}休战

287
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,470
{\an2}你长大了

288
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,380
{\an2}废话

289
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,380
你非得来布达佩施不可  是不是
You had to come to Budapest, didn't you?

290
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,770
你非得来布达佩施不可  是不是
You had to come to Budapest, didn't you?

291
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,610
我来这里是因为我以为你不会来
I came here because I thought you wouldn't.

292
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,720
不过既然你来了  那是什么子弹打的
But since you're here, what bullet does that?

293
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,930
不是子弹  是箭
Not bullets. Arrows.

294
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,050
也对
Ah, right.

295
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,910
如果你以为我不会来  那为什么要把这个给我
If you didn't think I'd come here, why'd you send me this?

296
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,440
你怎么又给带回来到这里了
You brought it back here?

297
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,960
我不是想要跟你交朋友
I'm not here trying to be your friend,

298
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,490
但是你得告诉我这是什么
but you need to tell me what that is.

299
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,130
这是一种合成气体
It's a synthetic gas.

300
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,390
它是化学控制剂的反作用剂
The counteragent to chemical subjugation.

301
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,350
这种气体可以让大脑中的神经系统
The gas immunizes the brain's neuropathways

302
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,660
对外来的操控免疫
from external manipulation.

303
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,190
能说人话吗
Maybe in English next time?

304
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,750
{\an2}这是精神控制的解药

305
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,620
{\an2}幼稚

306
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,860
你为什么不把它拿给你的那些超级科学家朋友们
Why don't you take it to one of your super-scientist friends?

307
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,080
他们可以解释给你听
They can explain it to you.

308
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,590
给托尼·斯塔克
Tony Stark, maybe?

309
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,350
我们现在可以说是绝交了  所以...
Oh, yeah. We're not really talking right now, so...

310
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,430
太棒了  时机真完美
Great. Perfect timing.

311
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,250
正需要复仇者的时候  他们都跑哪去了
Where's an Avenger when you need one?

312
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,960
我不想来这里的
I don't wanna be here.

313
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,970
我在逃亡  你说不定会害死我
I'm on the run. You could've gotten me killed.

314
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,810
那我该怎么做
Well, what was I supposed to do?

315
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,840
我就认识你这么一个超级英雄人
You're the only superhero person that I know.

316
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,170
所以我才交给你的
That was the whole reason I sent it to you.

317
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,600
我一直在关注新闻
I kept checking the news,

318
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:50,410
希望看到美国队长攻陷红房子的消息
expecting to see Captain America bringing down the Red Room.

319
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,740
什么
What?

320
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,060
攻陷红房子  你在说什么呢
Taking down the Red Room? What are you talking about?

321
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,510
它早就没了
It's been gone for years.

322
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,800
德雷科夫死了
Dreykov's dead.

323
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,080
我把他杀了
I killed him.

324
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,800
你不是真的相信吧
You don't actually believe that, do you?

325
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,930
你真的相信了
You really do believe that.

326
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,160
德雷科夫死了
Dreykov's dead.

327
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,010
我差不多毁掉了整座城市才干掉他
It took almost destroying the entire city just to get to him.

328
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,020
如果你那么确定  告诉我发生了什么
If you're so sure, then tell me what happened.

329
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,630
原原本本地告诉我
Tell me exactly.

330
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,700
我们引爆了炸弹
We rigged bombs.

331
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,410
-我们是谁  -克林特·巴顿
- Who's "we"? - Clint Barton.

332
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,060
杀掉德雷科夫是我
Killing Dreykov was the final step

333
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,660
投奔神盾局的最后一步
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

334
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,660
就那么简单
Simple as that?

335
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,800
当然  就那么"简单"
Yeah, sure, "simple."

336
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,760
我所谓的简单就是爆破了一栋五层的建筑物
That's what I'd call imploding a five-story building

337
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,430
然后和匈牙利特种部队交火
and then shooting it out with the Hungarian Special Forces.

338
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:43,880
我们躲了十天才找到机会逃出布达佩施
Took 10 days in hiding before we could even get out of Budapest.

339
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,970
你检查过尸体吗
And you checked the body?

340
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,110
确认他已经死了吗
Confirmed the kill?

341
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,740
现场没有什么可以检查的尸体
There was no body left to check.

342
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,860
你忘了还有德雷科夫的女儿
You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.

343
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,490
我们要去哪
Where are we trying to get?

344
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,530
摩托车  停在大楼的东边
Motorbike! East side of the building.

345
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,070
{\an2}她们往东边跑了  上了房顶

346
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,100
{\an2}收到  我去追

347
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,030
我抓住你了
I got you!

348
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,840
不
No!

349
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,070
别动  你受伤了
Don't move. You're hurt.

350
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,250
我来帮你
Let me help you.

351
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,410
{\an8}终结

352
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,470
我也不想这么做
I don't want to do this.

353
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,780
-你要干什么  -他在控制我
- What are you doing? - He's making me.

354
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,990
你现在相信我了吧
Do you believe me now?

355
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,430
还有多少人
How many others?

356
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,700
很多
Enough.

357
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,830
哪一辆是你的
Which one's yours?

358
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,120
黑色的  棕色坐垫
Black. Brown seat.

359
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,690
我的钥匙呢
Where are my keys?

360
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,290
{\an2}贱人

361
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,220
不用急着上来
Any day now.

362
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:00,890
{\an2}你们没事吧

363
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,150
{\an2}太棒了

364
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,600
你不能随便抢别人的车
You can't just steal a guy's car.

365
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,950
所以你希望我追踪到他再还回去吗
So you want me to chase him down and un-steal it?

366
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,940
-求你千万别急着开车  -闭嘴
- Okay. Any time now, please. - Shut up.

367
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,460
太好了  你是已经有计划了
Okay, you got a plan,

368
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,850
还是我应该趴下找掩护就好
or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?

369
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,850
是的  我的计划就是开车逃离这里
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

370
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,960
这计划糟透了
That's a shit plan.

371
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,220
不用客气
You're welcome.

372
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,810
该死  他又回来了
Oh, shit. He's back.

373
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,260
快系上安全带
Put your seat belt on.

374
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,470
你可真够啰嗦的
You're such a mom.

375
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,180
娜塔莎  不
Natasha, no.

376
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,370
我好像在流血  我
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

377
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,930
不  现在不行  相信我
No. Not now, trust me.

378
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,950
你没事吧
You okay?

379
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,770
没事  绝妙的计划
Yeah. Great plan.

380
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,900
我尤其喜欢我差点流血过多而死的那段
I love the part where I almost bled to death.

381
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,520
这里很舒适
This is cozy.

382
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,010
我和巴顿曾经在这上面躲了两天
Barton and I spent two days hiding out up here.

383
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,280
那一定很有意思
That must have been fun.

384
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,830
那家伙到底是谁
Who the hell is that guy?

385
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,850
德雷科夫的特别项目
Dreykov's special project.

386
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,980
他可以模仿任何他见过的人
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

387
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,700
就像对着镜子战斗一样
It's like fighting a mirror.

388
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,390
德雷科夫只在顶级任务里才会使用他
Dreykov only deploys him for top-priority missions.

389
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,800
这根本说不通
This doesn't make any sense.

390
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,420
如果你省略关键的细节  事实的确很难说得通
Well, the truth rarely makes sense when you omit key details.

391
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,900
什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

392
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,560
你提都没提过德雷科夫的女儿
You didn't say one word about Dreykov's daughter.

393
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,620
你杀了她
You killed her.

394
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,230
我必须杀了她
I had to.

395
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,790
我需要她引我找到德雷科夫
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

396
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,260
我们需要确定德雷科夫在那座建筑里
We need confirmation Dreykov's in the building.

397
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,940
他的车刚刚停下
His car is pulling up now.

398
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,340
德雷科夫的女儿是连带伤害
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

399
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,900
我需要他女儿来确认
I needed her to be sure.

400
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,330
娜塔莎  确认了吗
Natasha, we clear?

401
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,240
确认
All clear.

402
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,850
但现在你却不那么确定了
And here you are, not so sure.

403
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,240
我必须离开
I needed out.

404
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,050
红屋子仍在运作  那它现在在哪
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

405
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,210
我不知道
I have no idea.

406
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,160
他一直在换地点
He moves location constantly.

407
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,730
每名寡妇进出时
And every widow is sedated

408
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,520
都会被注射镇静剂  保持最高机密
on entry and exit for maximum security.

409
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,570
我真是不敢相信
I'm just finding it hard to believe

410
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,920
他一直都没有被我发现
that he could stay off my radar.

411
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:10,890
如果你想要潜藏起来
Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger

412
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,270
袭击一名复仇者可不是明智之举
if you want to stay hidden.

413
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,110
你们的名字就够说明问题了
I mean, the clue is in the name.

414
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,040
德雷科夫杀了你的话
Dreykov kills you,

415
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,510
某个大家伙一定会替你复仇的
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

416
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,430
等等  什么大家伙
Wait, what are the big ones?

417
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,350
我估计宇宙里的神
Well, I doubt the god from space

418
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,760
打完仗以后应该不需要吃布洛芬吧
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

419
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:29,520
你觉得我这段时间都在哪
Where did you think I was all this time?

420
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,430
我以为你离开了那里  过上了普通的生活
I thought that you got out and were living a normal life.

421
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,130
所以你就没再联系过我
And you just never made contact again?

422
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,020
说实话  我以为你不会想再见到我
Honestly, I thought you didn't wanna see me.

423
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,260
胡扯
Bullshit.

424
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,670
你就是不想让你的妹妹拖你的后腿
You just didn't want your baby sister to tag along,

425
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,600
这样你才能和厉害的家伙去拯救世界
whilst you saved the world with the cool kids.

426
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,940
你又不是我的亲妹妹
You weren't really my sister.

427
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,150
复仇者也不是你的血缘至亲
And the Avengers aren't really your family.

428
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,120
-你为什么总做那个动作  -什么动作
- Why do you always do that thing? - Do what?

429
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,900
每次打架的时候都做的那个动作
The thing you do when you're fighting.

430
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,940
那个  就像这样
The... Like, the...

431
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,250
你做的这个动作
This thing that you do

432
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,340
每次打架的时候你都会甩一下头发
when you whip your hair when you're fighting

433
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,980
手臂还要这样撑着
with the arm and the hair.

434
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,150
这就好像是你的战斗招牌动作
And you do, like, a fighting pose.

435
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,990
这就是你的招牌动作  你真是爱凹造型
It's a fighting pose. You're a total poser.

436
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,010
我才不爱凹造型
I'm not a poser.

437
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,110
得了吧  那些造型确实不错
Oh, come on. I mean, they're great poses,

438
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,100
但你看上去好像觉得每个人都在看着你似的
but it does look like you think everyone's looking at you, like,

439
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,980
一直这样
all the time.

440
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,610
我凹造型的时候
All that time that I spent posing,

441
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,410
其实是想做些什么
I was trying to actually do something

442
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,130
来弥补我们造成的痛苦和磨难
to make up for all the pain and suffering that we caused.

443
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,370
不想只是单纯当一个训练有素的杀手
Trying to be more than just a trained killer.

444
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,050
那你只是在骗你自己罢了
Well, then you were fooling yourself

445
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,450
因为痛苦和磨难每天都有
because pain and suffering is every day

446
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,510
我们也依旧还是训练有素的杀手
and we are both still a trained killer.

447
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,610
只不过我不会登上杂志封面
Except I'm not the one that's on the cover of a magazine.

448
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,710
我不是那种会被小女孩称为英雄的杀手
I'm not the killer that little girls call their hero.

449
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,810
那种气体
That gas,

450
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,860
那个反作用剂
the counteragent,

451
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,110
是由一个梅丽娜那一代的
it was synthesized in secret

452
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,200
老一辈寡妇暗中合成的
by an older widow from Melina's generation.

453
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,620
我当时的任务是取回它  她对我喷了这个气体
I was on the mission to retrieve it, and she exposed me

454
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,100
而我把那个还给我自由的寡妇杀了
and I killed the widow that freed me.

455
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,030
你当时有别的选择吗
Did you have a choice?

456
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,860
你所经历的是心理训练
What you experienced was psychological conditioning.

457
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,890
而我经历的是被化学物质改变大脑运作方式
I'm talking about chemically altering brain functions.

458
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,170
这是两种完全不同的情况
They're two completely different things.

459
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,100
你意识完全清醒  但你不知道哪一部分是你
You're fully conscious, but you don't know which part is you.

460
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,090
我现在还是不确定
I'm still not sure.

461
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,360
就剩下这些了吗
Is that all there is left?

462
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,330
这是唯一能阻止德雷科夫
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov

463
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,360
和他的寡妇网络的东西
and his network of widows.

464
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,280
他招募的人越来越多
He takes more every day.

465
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,860
那些没有人保护的小孩
Children who don't have anyone to protect them.

466
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,810
就像我们小时候那样
Just like us when we were small.

467
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,680
可能20个人中能有1个活过训练  成为寡妇
Maybe one in 20 survives the training, becomes a widow.

468
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,990
其余的都会被他杀死
The rest, he kills.

469
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,000
对他来说  我们只是物件罢了
To him, we are just things.

470
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,240
他可以随意抛弃的没有面容的武器
Weapons with no face that he can just throw away.

471
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,890
因为总会有更多的人
Because there is always more.

472
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,130
多亏了你和阿列克谢  甚至没有人在找他
And no one's even looking for him, thanks to you and Alexei.

473
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,350
阿列克谢
Alexei?

474
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,150
"爸爸"
"Dad."

475
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,200
你找过你的父母吗  亲生父母
Did you ever look for your parents? Your real ones?

476
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,380
我的母亲像丢垃圾一样把我遗弃在街道上
Well, my mom abandoned me in the street like garbage.

477
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:56,870
你呢
What about you?

478
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:02,630
他们毁了我的出生证明  所以我重新自创了一个
They destroyed my birth certificate, so I reinvented it.

479
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,580
我的父母还住在俄亥俄州
My parents still live in Ohio.

480
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,880
我的姐姐搬到了西部
My sister moved out west.

481
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,000
这样吗
Is that right?

482
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,440
你是一个科学老师
You're a science teacher.

483
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,030
不过只是兼职工作
You're working part-time, though,

484
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,770
特别是有了儿子之后
especially after you had your son.

485
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,810
你丈夫的工作是翻新房子
Your husband, he renovates houses.

486
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:20,430
这可不是我的故事
That is not my story.

487
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,300
那你的故事是什么
What is your story?

488
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,980
我独处的时间都还没来得及想这个问题
I never let myself be alone long enough to think about it.

489
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,930
你有想过要孩子吗
Did you ever wish for kids?

490
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,490
我想养条狗
I want a dog.

491
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,800
你打算去哪
Where you gonna go?

492
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,300
我不知道
I don't know.

493
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,330
我并没有什么地方可以回
I don't really have anywhere to go back to,

494
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,970
所以我猜去什么地方都可能
so I guess anywhere.

495
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,150
-不要这样  -不要怎么样
- Don't. - Don't what?

496
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,500
你打算给我一段大英雄式的演讲
You're going to give me some big hero speech,

497
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,650
我能感觉到
I can feel it.

498
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,030
我不怎么擅长演讲
Speeches aren't really my thing.

499
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,580
更像是一份邀请
It was more like an invitation.

500
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,050
去红房子然后杀了德雷科夫
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

501
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,760
没错
Yeah.

502
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,300
即使红房子几乎不可能被找到
Even though the Red Room is impossible to find

503
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,320
德雷科夫狡诈多端  刺杀难度很高吗
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

504
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,740
没错
Yeah.

505
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,980
听起来工作量很大
That sounds like a shitload of work.

506
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,850
没错
Yup.

507
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,440
但可能很有趣
Could be fun, though.

508
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,120
没错
Yup.

509
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,830
我看到他把钥匙放在哪了
I saw where he put the keys.

510
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,780
绿色的柜子  最顶上的抽屉
Top drawer, green cabinet.

511
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,890
你知道吗  这是我给自己买的
You know, this is the first piece of clothing

512
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,590
第一件衣服
I've ever bought for myself.

513
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,400
是吗
That?

514
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,550
是啊  你不喜欢吗
Yeah. You don't like it?

515
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,650
这件是不是...
Is that like a...

516
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,470
是不是那种军用服装  还是...
Is it army surplus, or...

517
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,570
行了  它是有很多口袋
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

518
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,530
但这些口袋一直很有用
But I use them all the time,

519
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,930
而且我还做了自己的一些改装
and I made some of my own modifications.

520
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,260
随便了
Whatever.

521
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,810
闭嘴  重要的是  我从来没有...
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

522
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,770
我从来没掌控过自己的生活  但现在我能掌控了
I've never had control over my own life before, and now I do.

523
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,270
我想要做些什么
I want to do things.

524
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,100
我喜欢你的背心
I like your vest.

525
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,920
我就知道  我就知道你喜欢  很酷吧
I knew it. I knew you did. It's so cool, right?

526
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,190
很棒  没错  我喜欢
It's good. Yes. I like it.

527
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:40,430
而且你能往里面放许多东西  多到你难以想象
And you can put so much stuff in there. You wouldn't even know.

528
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,800
不过我确实不知道红房子在哪
I really don't know where the Red Room is, though.

529
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,280
-抱歉  -我知道
- I'm sorry. - I know.

530
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,150
但我想我认识一个知道的人
But I think I know somebody who does.

531
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,160
是吗  谁
Oh, yeah? Who?

532
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,120
我们需要一架喷气机
We're gonna need a jet.

533
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,790
我说我们需要的是喷气机
I said we needed a jet.

534
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,600
你知道你没给我什么吗  时间
Yeah, you know what you didn't give me? Time.

535
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,390
还有钱  我又不是喷气机做的
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

536
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,910
我还以为你是最强的
I thought you were supposed to be the best.

537
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,150
是个专业高手
Like a real pro.

538
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,430
对不起  皇后殿下
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

539
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,360
免费的公寓和能吃一辈子的甜品
Was the free flat and lifetime supply of kissel

540
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,640
没能让您满意吗
not to your liking?

541
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,470
别被她的挑衅激怒
Don't let her wind you up.

542
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,710
我很讨厌别人怀疑我的专业素养
No, I take exception to impugning my professionalism.

543
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,220
之前那个六个小时就坏掉的
Well, you did set me up with a generator

544
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,140
垃圾发电机不就是你做的吗
that crapped out after six hours.

545
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:22,040
你也来  你们真是一队
You, too, huh? Tag team.

546
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,090
小朋友好敏感  难怪你和他亲近
Aw, he's sensitive. See why you keep him around.

547
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,310
其他的呢
Where's the rest?

548
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,200
这呢
Voilà.

549
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,280
这是我五年前放的
Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago.

550
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,940
味道怎么样
How is it?

551
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,920
不愧是干粮  特别干
It's dry. It's really dry.

552
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,090
你在我这的信用额度
You know, you're getting dangerously close

553
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:53,400
快要用光了
to running out your tab.

554
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,030
物资还没什么  但是你害得
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me

555
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,080
当局开始注意到我了
attention from the authorities,

556
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,500
我的报价就要升高了
all my prices go up.

557
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,980
你这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

558
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,250
你的老伙计  罗斯国务卿一直在打探我的消息
Your mate, Secretary Ross, has been sniffing around my affairs

559
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,290
弄得我的线人现在已经不接我电话了
to the point at which I've got contacts declining my calls.

560
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,330
我成私人承包商了
I'm a private contractor.

561
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,090
你确实很敏感
You are sensitive.

562
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,020
你可太讨人厌了
You're a very annoying individual.

563
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,690
我会补偿你的
I'll make it up to you.

564
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,740
你每次都这么说
That's what you say every time.

565
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,640
我手握核武器密码
So, I have the nuclear code.

566
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,530
但是那个男人出现了
But there he is.

567
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,070
-美国队长  -队长
- Captain America! - America.

568
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:45,820
终于  该红色卫兵出手了
Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!

569
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,430
我抓住了他的盾
I grab hold of his shield

570
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:54,420
面对面肉搏  这是力量的较量
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

571
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,700
不  不
Oh, no.

572
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,370
这小伙子以为能赢我呢
That guy think he going to beat me.

573
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,990
总之  你们知道那个盾牌吧
Anyway, this shield, you know, that he carries with him

574
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,810
像宝宝毯一样一直被他带在身边
like a precious baby blanket, you know?

575
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:16,140
我利用了那面盾  我拿着盾
I use it to my advantage. I take it

576
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,070
直接把他推倒了窗外
and I push him out the window.

577
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,090
然后我就逃走了
And I make my escape. Huh?

578
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,370
这是几几年的事
What year was this?

579
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:26,070
我记不清了  83或者84年吧
I don't know. Like, '83, '84.

580
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:26,850
我知道
I know.

581
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:30,080
那时候美国队长还是个老冰棍呢
Captain America was still frozen in ice then.

582
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,510
你是说我在撒谎吗  大熊熊
Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?

583
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,120
{\an2}阿列克谢·肖斯塔科夫  有你的信件

584
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,240
不
Oh, no.

585
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,980
{\an2}阿列克谢·肖斯塔科夫  有你的信件

586
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,360
看看这只大熊熊
Look at the big bear.

587
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,520
要哭了  小妹妹 
Gonna cry, little girl?

588
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:16,080
{\an2}大名鼎鼎的"红色卫兵"

589
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:21,860
{\an2}回信的时候记得告诉你家小粉丝
下次多放点黄油

590
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,780
{\an2}拿着吧

591
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,710
{\an2}快点

592
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,960
{\an2}红色卫兵冲锋
号角已经吹响

593
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,450
你的好日子到了  阿列克谢
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

594
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,610
去南边的出口那里
Move to the door on the south wall.

595
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:28,500
{\an2}你怎么了

596
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,650
{\an2}是不是不识字啊

597
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,160
左转
Go left.

598
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,860
别闹太大动静
Just don't make a scene.

599
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,820
{\an2}红色卫兵越狱了

600
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,170
你就是不听话是不是
You made a scene, didn't you?

601
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,180
现在怎么办
What now?

602
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,370
我们带你出去
We're gettin' you outta here.

603
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,210
去上面一层
Go to the upper level.

604
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,650
跑快点  超级士兵
Move your ass, super soldier.

605
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,880
他跑不掉的
He's never going to make it.

606
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,080
飞得近一点
Get me closer.

607
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:01,660
你还有别的好办法吗
You got a better idea?

608
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,180
娜塔莎
Natasha.

609
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,380
真能凹造型
Such a poser.

610
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,460
搞笑呢
Seriously?

611
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:50,460
抱歉啦
Sorry!

612
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,730
你在搞什么  逗我呢
What are you doing? Are you kidding me?

613
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,030
往后退
Back up!

614
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,790
我们都做得很好
We're both doing a really good job.

615
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,790
不是吧
No.

616
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,610
行吧  我真是受够了
Okay. Enough of this.

617
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,530
这么死掉还挺酷的
This would be a cool way to die.

618
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,680
告诉我这是有利的情形
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

619
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,800
快跑
Move your ass!

620
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,560
快带我们离开
Get us outta here!

621
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,250
等等我
Wait!

622
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,510
爽
Yes!

623
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,930
快来帮帮我
I need some help up here!

624
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:49,390
{\an2}再你妈的见  傻逼们

625
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,470
刚才真是刺激
Oh, that was exciting.

626
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,780
我真为你们感到骄傲
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

627
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,940
对  你们听不到我说话
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

628
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,950
好吧
Okay.

629
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:18,370
行吧
Okay.

630
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,960
怎么这么暴躁
Why the aggression, huh?

631
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,530
你大姨妈来了
Is it your time of the month?

632
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:27,360
我没有大姨妈  蠢货  我连子宫都没有
I don't get my period, dipshit. I don't have a uterus.

633
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,490
还有卵巢
Or ovaries.

634
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,830
都是由于红房子给我们做的
Yeah. That's what happens when the Red Room

635
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,480
强制子宫切除术
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

636
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,850
他们直接进入你的体内
They kind of just go in and they rip out

637
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,400
把所有的生殖器官都切掉了
all of your reproductive organs.

638
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,880
直接把手伸进去切切切
They just get right in there and they chop them all away.

639
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,880
全部切掉  你就不能生育了
Everything out, so you can't have babies.

640
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,880
{\an8}够了  够了  够了
Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

641
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,640
你能不能不要这么冷漠又恶心
You don't have to get so clinical and nasty.

642
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,970
我还想跟你说说切除输卵管呢
Oh, well, I was about to talk about fallopian tubes, 

643
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,340
-你不想听就算了  -不想听
- but okay. - No.

644
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:56,970
你们为我回来  我真是太感动了
It means so much to me that you came back for me.

645
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:00,190
不不  你要告诉我们怎么去找红房子
No. No. You're gonna tell us how to get to the Red Room.

646
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,110
瞧瞧你  只谈公事
Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.

647
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:05,760
相信我  这不是享乐之旅
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

648
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,160
小娜塔莎  被灌输的全是西方思想
Little Natasha, all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.

649
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,090
我自己选择去西方做复仇者
I chose to go west to become an Avenger.

650
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,390
因为他们待我如家人
'Cause they treated me like family.

651
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,390
真的吗  家人
Really? Family?

652
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,420
那他们现在在哪
Well, where are they now?

653
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,720
你的家人现在在哪
Where is that family now?

654
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,200
告诉我红房子在哪
Tell me where the Red Room is.

655
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:29,220
我不知道
I have no idea.

656
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:30,780
行了吗
Okay?

657
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:37,940
拜托  你和德雷科夫就像...
Come on. You and Dreykov were like...

658
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:38,960
-德雷科夫  -是啊
- Dreykov? - Yeah.

659
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,020
德雷科夫将军  我的朋友
General Dreykov, my friend, huh?

660
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,280
给我荣耀...
Gives me glory...

661
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,220
苏联第一个也是唯一一个超级战士
Soviet Union's first and only super soldier.

662
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,320
我本可以比美国队长更出名的
I could have been more famous than Captain America.

663
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:53,900
然后他派我窝在俄亥俄执行那个愚蠢的任务
Then he buries me in Ohio on that stupid mission.

664
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,540
三年
Three years!

665
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,440
无聊至极  让我无聊到哭
So tedious, boring me to tears.

666
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,970
无意冒犯
No offense, huh?

667
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,790
然后让我在监狱里度过余生  为什么
Then puts me in prison for the rest of my life. Why, huh?

668
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:08,330
为什么  他为什么要把我放进...你知道吗
Why? Why would he put me in... You know why?

669
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:10,960
也许因为我想谈谈国家的衰败
'Cause maybe I want to talk about the withering of the state.

670
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,800
或者因为我不喜欢他的头发什么的
Or maybe I don't like his hair or something

671
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,250
然后我就随便说点什么
and I say something casually about that.

672
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,210
也许
Maybe, you know,

673
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:17,600
我想让党像个真正的好组织
I want the Party to feel actually like a party

674
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,610
而不是这种苦闷的组织
instead of this sourpuss organization.

675
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,250
但是  不行
But instead, no.

676
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,540
他让我在监狱里度过余生
He puts me in prison for the rest of my life.

677
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,930
他就这么跑了  躲起来了
He just runs off and hides, huh?

678
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,030
我甚至都不是那个...
I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...

679
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:35,880
不是我杀了他女儿
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

680
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,120
同意  我们现在能把他扔出窗外了吗
Agree. Can we throw him out the window now?

681
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:41,430
我觉得我们应该等到更高的高度
I think we should wait till we get to a higher altitude.

682
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,630
{\an2}为什么不问梅丽娜红房子在哪

683
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,520
{\an8}好吧
All right.

684
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,090
等等  梅丽娜妈妈
Wait, Mom Melina?

685
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,300
我们以为她死了
We thought she was dead.

686
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:51,160
狡猾的狐狸是杀不死的
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

687
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,400
怎么了
What?

688
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:57,290
她是科学家  战略家  我是打手
She was the scientist, the strategist. I was the muscle.

689
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,760
相比于我  她更算是直接为德雷科夫工作
She worked directly for Dreykov far more than I ever did.

690
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,260
等等  你是说梅丽娜
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina

691
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,530
现在在红房子工作吗
is working for the Red Room present day?

692
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:06,150
她在圣彼得堡外远程工作
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

693
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,560
我觉得我们的燃料不够去圣彼得堡
I don't think we have enough fuel for St. Petersburg.

694
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,590
不  我们能到的
No, we're good. We'll make it.

695
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,030
好吧
Okay.

696
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,460
你应该带上复仇者联盟的超级喷气机
You should've brought the Avengers' superjet.

697
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:42,690
我发誓  如果他再多说一个字
I swear, if I hear one more word from him,

698
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,490
-我会踢他的脸  -他最差劲了
- I will kick him in the face. - He's the worst.

699
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:46,110
娜塔莎
Natasha.

700
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,490
娜塔莎  娜塔莎
Natasha. Natasha.

701
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,090
过来  我想问你点事
Come here, I want to ask you something.

702
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,270
-过来  这很重要  -什么
- Come, it's important. - What?

703
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,340
他跟你说起过我吗
Did he talk to you about me?

704
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,570
什么
What?

705
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:06,230
他跟你说起过我吗  你懂的  贸易战的事
Did he talk to you about me? You know, trading war stories?

706
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,110
谁  你在说什么
Who? What are you talking about?

707
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,370
美国队长
Captain America.

708
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:14,950
我在这场地缘政治冲突戏剧中的劲敌
My great adversary in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

709
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:16,690
也不算是死敌
Not so much a nemesis.

710
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:19,060
更像是英雄惜英雄  你懂吗  亲密对手
More like a contemporary, you know? Coequal.

711
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,420
我一直认为我们互相尊重...
I always thought there was a great deal of mutual respect...

712
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,640
等等  你有二十年没见过我们了
Wait. You haven't seen either one of us in 20 years

713
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,350
你还想问我关于你的事
and you're gonna ask me about you?

714
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,290
为什么这么剑拔弩张
What is with this tension?

715
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,140
我做错什么了吗
Did I do something wrong?

716
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:35,150
这是个认真的问题吗
Is that a serious question?

717
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,090
我对你们只有爱
I only ever loved you girls.

718
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,160
我尽我所能确保你们能
I did my best to make sure you would succeed

719
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,790
成功发挥你们最大的潜能
to achieve your fullest potential,

720
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,760
-然后一切都很顺利  -都都很顺利吗
- and everything worked out. - Everything worked out?

721
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,950
对  对你来说  是啊
Yes. For you, yes.

722
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:51,500
我们在俄亥俄州完成了任务
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

723
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,740
叶莲娜  你后来成为了有史以来
Yelena, you went on to become the greatest child assassin

724
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,130
世界上最棒的儿童杀手
the world has ever known.

725
01:06:56,430 --> 01:07:00,330
没人能比得上你的效率和冷酷
No one can match your efficiency, your ruthlessness.

726
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,120
还有娜塔莎
And Natasha,

727
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,390
不只是间谍  不只是推翻政权
not just a spy, not just toppling regimes,

728
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,740
从内部瓦解帝国
destroying empires from within,

729
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,540
而是复仇者
but an Avenger.

730
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,290
你们都杀了
You both have killed

731
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,530
那么多人
so many people.

732
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:22,780
你们的名册肯定在滴血  血流成河
Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red.

733
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,740
我太为你们骄傲了
I couldn't be more proud of you.

734
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:31,570
好了  你可以...
Okay. You can... No.

735
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,040
可以放开我了
Let go of me now.

736
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:35,050
你身上真难闻
You smell really bad.

737
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:42,300
我们到了吗
So, are we there yet?

738
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,950
到了你就知道了
You'll know when we're there.

739
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,140
稍右一点
Slight right.

740
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:50,770
直走
Straight on.

741
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,460
对
Right.

742
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,200
稍右一点
Slight right.

743
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,720
非常好  亲爱的
Oh, very good, my darling.

744
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,760
非常棒
Yes, very good.

745
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:05,320
非常好  亲爱的
Yes, very good, my darling.

746
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,510
回到安全的窝里  去吧
Back home where it's safe. Come on. Go on.

747
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,150
亲爱的  我们回来了
Honey, we're home.

748
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:25,840
来吧  姑娘们
Come on, girls.

749
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,010
欢迎光临寒舍
Welcome to my humble abode.

750
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:41,510
大家随意  别客气
Make yourself at home.

751
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,380
我们来喝点东西吧
Let's have a drink.

752
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,280
别胡闹
Hey, no funny business.

753
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,400
我要把武器收起来
I am putting away my weapon.

754
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,750
这附近有饵雷吗
Are there any booby traps around here?

755
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,840
有什么需要注意的吗
Anything we need to know about?

756
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,920
我养大女儿可不是为了让她们落入陷阱的
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

757
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,300
我们根本不是你养大的
You didn't raise us at all.

758
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,880
或许吧
Maybe so.

759
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,020
但如果你变弱了  也不是我的错
But if you got soft, it wasn't on my watch.

760
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,860
喝吧
Let's drink.

761
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,420
没事
Okay.

762
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:22,840
还是很合身
Still fits.

763
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,000
天哪
Oh, my God.

764
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,080
我一次都没洗过
I never washed it once.

765
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:32,290
来喝点东西吧
Come and drink.

766
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:38,000
*救恩的工人哪  起来吧*
*Rise, you workers of salvation*

767
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,330
家人
Family

768
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,650
又团聚了
back together again.

769
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:48,430
鉴于我们的
Seeing as our

770
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:50,010
家庭结构
family construct

771
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:52,860
是一个只维持了三年的精心计谋
was just a calculated ruse that only lasted three years,

772
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:57,470
我想我们不能再用这个词了  对吧
I don't think that we can use this term anymore, can we?

773
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,990
同意  计划是这样的
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

774
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:03,020
好吧  那就叫重聚吧
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

775
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:07,420
现在我想说几句
I want to say something right off the bat.

776
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:09,520
你一点都没变老  是吧
You haven't aged a day, huh?

777
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,180
你还是和当年我们结婚时
You're just as beautiful and as supple

778
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,750
一样美丽动人
as the day they staged our marriage.

779
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,650
你发福了
You got fat.

780
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,930
但是风采依旧
But still good.

781
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,300
我刚从牢里出来  那个...
I just got out of prison. I, uh...

782
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,200
精力无处发泄
I have a lot of energy.

783
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:28,740
拜托打住
Please don't do that.

784
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,510
所以  计划是这样
So, here's what's gonna happen.

785
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:35,360
娜塔莎  别佝偻着背
Natasha, don't slouch.

786
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,880
-我没有啊  -不  不  你有  
- I'm not slouching. Yes, yes, you are.

787
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,690
我从来不弓着背
I don't slouch.

788
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,250
你这样以后会驼背的
You're going to get a back hunch.

789
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:41,890
-听你妈妈的  -天哪  这简直
- Listen to your mother. NATASHA: Oh, my God, this...

790
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:42,510
背挺直  挺直
Up, up.

791
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,200
好了  够了你们所有人
All right, enough. All of you.

792
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,130
我什么都没说  这不公平
I didn't say anything. That's not fair.

793
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,920
-计划是这样的  -我什么都不想吃
- Here's what's gonna happen... - I don't want any food.

794
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,980
吃点东西吧  叶莲娜  看在上帝的份上
Eat a little something, Yelena, for God's sake.

795
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,700
你要告诉我们红房子的位置
You're gonna tell us the location of the Red Room.

796
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,400
你知道吗  这就好像那时你告诉她们
You know, it's like when you told them

797
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,490
她们可以熬夜等待圣诞老人
that they could stay up late to catch Santa Claus.

798
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:03,130
怎么了很好玩啊  "他从烟囱下来了  姑娘们"
What? That was fun. You know, "He come down the chimney, girls."

799
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,190
"注意  他在哪儿"
"Look out. Where is he?"

800
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:07,530
你等着他出现  然后当饼干不见的时候
You wait for him, and then when the cookies are gone,

801
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,210
你就会看到他在那里
then you see he's there.

802
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,520
不  不  怎么了  我希望
No, no. What? I want them

803
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,220
-追寻她们的梦想  -没用的
- to follow their dreams. - No good.

804
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,290
伸手摘星辰吧  姑娘们
Reach for the stars, girls.

805
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:18,230
找到德雷科夫不是幻想  这是未竟的事业
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy. It's unfinished business.

806
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:21,770
你无法打败一个能控制他人意志的人
You can't defeat a man who commands the very will of others.

807
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:25,910
你从不知道我们在美国开始的事业如何收场
You never saw the culmination of what we started in America.

808
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,220
你也是
Nor did you.

809
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:34,690
娜塔莎  永远都要集中精神  要什么就去争取
Natasha, always focus, focus. Get what you want.

810
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:42,810
进来
Come in.

811
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,560
刚刚那只猪是自己开的门吗
Did that pig just open the door?

812
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,850
没错  是的
Yes. It did.

813
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:56,520
乖孩子  阿列克谢  乖孩子 
Good boy, Alexei. Good boy.

814
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,470
你给一只猪起了跟我一样的名字
You named a pig after me?

815
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,950
你看不出你俩的相似之处吗
You don't see the resemblance?

816
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,450
你看  他像只狗一样坐着
See, he sits just like dog.

817
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,680
很神奇的  看
Amazing. Now, watch.

818
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,200
对我来说有点怪怪的
It's a little weird, to me.

819
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,960
停止呼吸
Stop breathing.

820
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:21,480
我们潜入了俄亥俄州的北方机构
We infiltrated the North Institute in Ohio.

821
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,150
那是神盾局科学家的幌子
It was a front for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

822
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:26,390
实际上  那时候是九头蛇的科学家
Actually, it was Hydra scientists at that time.

823
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,350
在冬日战士计划中
In conjunction with the Winter Soldier project,

824
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:31,440
他们解剖并解构了人类的大脑
they had dissected and deconstructed the human brain

825
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:33,080
创造了第一个也是唯一一个
to create the first and only

826
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,300
基底神经节的细胞蓝图
cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

827
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,870
这是认知的中心
Was the hub for cognition.

828
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:40,680
自主运动  程序性学习都靠这个
Voluntary motor movement, procedural learning.

829
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:46,010
我们没有偷武器或技术
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

830
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:49,490
我们偷走了开启自由意志的钥匙
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

831
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:56,260
你在干什么
What are you doing?

832
01:14:56,330 --> 01:15:00,240
我在解释现在的科学是如此精确
I am explaining that the science is now so exact,

833
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:02,430
实验对象可以被指示停止呼吸
the subject can be instructed to stop breathing

834
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:04,450
别无选择只能遵命
and has no choice but to obey.

835
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:06,300
好了  我们明白了  停下吧
Okay, you made your point. That's enough.

836
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,460
好的  别担心  阿列克谢还能再憋11秒
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry, Alexei could've survived

837
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,250
才会死
11 more seconds without oxygen.

838
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:15,460
好孩子  现在你可以回去了  回到安全的窝里
Good boy. Now, you go back, back home where it's safe.

839
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,220
回到安全的窝里
You go back, back home where it's safe.

840
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:20,780
真乖  阿列克谢
Good boy, Alexei.

841
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:24,280
当世界被操控时  其运转效率能上一个层次
The world functions on a higher level when it is controlled.

842
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,420
德雷科夫用化学武器
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents

843
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,330
制服了遍布全球的特工
planted around the globe.

844
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,320
你知道他们用谁做测试吗
And do you know who they test it on?

845
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:35,570
不知道  那不是我的工作范畴
No. That's not my department.

846
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:36,900
行了  行了
Come on, come on.

847
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:38,980
-别骗她们  -我没骗她们
- Don't lie to them? - I'm not lying.

848
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,480
你是德雷科夫的建筑师  对吧
You're Dreykov's architect, huh?

849
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,100
那你是谁呢
What were you?

850
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,690
如果我是他的建筑师  你就是他的合伙人
If I was his architect, you were his partner.

851
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:44,380
你是他的商业合伙人
You were his business partner.

852
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,590
不不不  我被骗了
No, no, no. I was patsy!

853
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,520
-别跟我说  -他向我推销意识形态
- Don't give me that... - He sell me ideology.

854
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:49,480
-别扯政治  -一直以来  更大的
- Stop with the politics. - All the while, bigger...

855
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,420
闭嘴  你是个笨蛋
Shut up! You are an idiot.

856
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,710
你是个胆小鬼
And you're a coward.

857
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,520
你是个胆小鬼
You're a coward.

858
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:04,160
我们的家庭从来不是真的
And our family was never real,

859
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,990
所以没什么好坚持的了
so there's nothing to hold on to.

860
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,190
我们该继续向前了
We're moving on.

861
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:12,290
从来不是家人吗
Never family, huh?

862
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:14,800
在我心中  我是个简单的人
In my heart, I am simple man.

863
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:19,420
我想  作为一对潜伏的俄国特工
And I think that for a couple deep undercover Russian agents

864
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,860
我想我们做父母做得很好了
I think we did pretty great as parents, huh?

865
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:23,140
是的  我们有各自的命令
Yes, we had our orders,

866
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,480
各自的角色做得很好
and we played our roles to perfection.

867
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,080
谁在乎  那不是真的
Who cares? That wasn't real.

868
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:30,910
-什么  -那不是真的  谁在乎
- What? - That wasn't real. Who cares?

869
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:32,080
别这么说
Don't say that.

870
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:35,350
别这么说  那是真的
Please don't say that. It was real.

871
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:38,790
对我来说是真的  你是我的妈妈
It was real to me. You are my mother.

872
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,240
你是我真的妈妈
You were my real mother.

873
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,760
是我拥有过最像妈妈的人
The closest thing I ever had to one.

874
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,920
我人生中最美好的部份是假的
The best part of my life was fake.

875
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:52,220
你们从没有人告诉过我
And none of you told me.

876
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:57,600
那些全球各地
And those agents

877
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,510
被你用化学药剂制服的特工
you chemically subjugated around the globe?

878
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,610
是我
That was me.

879
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:12,610
你呢  你逃了出去
And you, you got out.

880
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:15,070
徳雷科夫不会放过任何人的
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

881
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:17,750
你打算说什么吗
Are you gonna say anything?

882
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:22,660
没有
No.

883
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,210
别碰我
Don't touch me.

884
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,200
叶莲娜
Yelena.

885
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,360
不要
No.

886
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,970
-我都不知道  -没事的  没事的
- I had no idea. - It's okay, it's okay.

887
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,730
我去跟她谈谈
I'll go talk to her.

888
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,050
我进这里来是因为我不想说话
I came in here because I didn't want to talk.

889
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,400
好的
Okay.

890
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:03,690
我们  我们就坐着
We, uh... We just sit.

891
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,340
我们就坐着
We just sit.

892
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:20,950
你要去哪
Where are you going?

893
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,650
-我自己去解决这件事  -别  你会死的
- To do this myself. - Don't. You won't survive.

894
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:25,980
我真希望我能相信你在乎
I wish I could believe that you cared.

895
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:29,010
但你甚至不是第一个抛弃我的妈妈
But you're not even the first mother that abandoned me.

896
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,900
不  你不是被抛弃的
No, you weren't abandoned.

897
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,060
你是被
You were selected by a program

898
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:35,880
一个评估婴儿潜力的程序选中的
that assessed the genetic potential in infants.

899
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:46,850
我是被掳走的吗
I was taken?

900
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:51,160
我相信是一笔交易  你的家人得到了不少好处
I believe a bargain was struck, your family paid off.

901
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,090
但你妈妈  她从未停止过找你
But your mother, she never stopped looking for you.

902
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:56,830
她在那方面很像你  她
She was like you in that way. She was

903
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:58,380
不知放弃
relentless.

904
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,890
她怎么了
What happened to her?

905
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:04,510
徳雷科夫杀了她
Dreykov had her killed.

906
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,610
她的存在威胁到了红屋子
Her existence threatened to uncover the Red Room.

907
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,130
通常来说  一个好奇平民的举动
Normally, the actions of one curious civilian

908
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:13,470
不会招致杀害
wouldn't warrant an execution,

909
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:16,030
但  正如我所说  她不知放弃
but, as I said, she was relentless.

910
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,300
我每天都会想到她
I thought about her every day of my life.

911
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:29,020
不管我自己承不承认  我的确会想她
Whether or not I admitted it to myself, I did.

912
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:34,470
我一直认为最好不要回首过去
I've always found it best not to look into the past.

913
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,820
那你为什么要留着这个
Then why did you save this?

914
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,270
我记得这一天
I remember this day.

915
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,700
我们在一天内拍了圣诞节
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter

916
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,720
感恩节  复活节和暑假
and summer vacation all in one day.

917
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,730
不同的背景幕布
Different backdrops.

918
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:16,440
我知道树下所有的礼物
I knew all the presents under the tree

919
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,520
都只是空盒子  但我不在乎
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

920
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,130
我想打开没一个盒子
I wanted to open every single one...

921
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,910
所以在那一瞬间  我感觉是真的
so just for a second it would feel real.

922
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,620
不要再看了
Let's stop this.

923
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,190
你为什么要这么做
Why you doing this?

924
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:43,000
为什么出生在笼子的老鼠会在小轮子上跑
Why does a mouse born in a cage run on that little wheel?

925
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:46,380
你知道在你出生前
Do you know I was cycled through the Red Room

926
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,710
我就被抓回红屋子四次吗
four times before you were even born?

927
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,940
我只知道那些围墙
Those walls are all I know.

928
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:53,380
我从无选择的余地
I was never given a choice.

929
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,060
但你不是老鼠  梅丽娜
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

930
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,610
你只是出生在笼子中  但那不是你的错
You were just born in a cage, but that's not your fault.

931
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,230
告诉我  你是如何保持你的心的
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

932
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:16,560
痛苦只会让我们更坚强
Pain only makes us stronger.

933
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:19,200
那不是你告诉我们的吗
Didn't you tell us that?

934
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:23,780
你教我的东西让我得以生存
What you taught me kept me alive.

935
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:30,130
对不起  我已经通知了红屋子
I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.

936
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:31,840
他们随时都会赶来
They'll be here any minute.

937
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:39,150
我和我爸爸在冰上钓鱼
So, there I am ice fishing with my father.

938
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,810
那个小小的冰棚屋里非常冷
It's very cold day in this little ice shed.

939
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,540
对于俄罗斯来说都算冷的  你知道吗
Cold even for Russia, you know?

940
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,060
"把伏特加放在火边"  我爸爸对我说
"Keep the vodka by the fire," my father would say to me.

941
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,210
拜托别说了
Please stop talking.

942
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,270
-请等一等  等一等  -拜托  别
- Please wait. Please wait. - Please, no.

943
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,040
拜托  我不想聊天
Please, I don't want to talk.

944
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,720
拜托  拜托
Please. Please.

945
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:56,100
我告诉你这些是有原因的  好吗  相信我
There is a reason why I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.

946
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,380
我正在伸手去抓鱼
I am reaching for fish.

947
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:02,740
我失去了平衡
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

948
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,950
水花四溅
Splash!

949
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,100
我的手掉进了河里
My hands go in the river.

950
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:10,180
在那种天气里  很快就会冻伤
In this weather, frostbite sets in quick.

951
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:14,380
我爸爸  他在我手上撒了泡尿
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

952
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:15,120
我的天
Oh, my God.

953
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:20,650
尿液有35摄氏度  能够缓解冻伤
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius, staves off the frostbite.

954
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:22,120
说这些有什么用
How is this relevant?

955
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,040
这就是父亲啊
You know, fathers.

956
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,150
不  不
No. No.

957
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,950
你说这些只会让我觉得你特别无趣
You have done nothing but tell me how bored you were.

958
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:39,650
对你来说  我就是一项烦人的任务
I was the chore, the job you didn't want to do.

959
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,160
对于我来说呢
To me?

960
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:44,580
对于我来说  你就是一切
To me, you were everything.

961
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,610
没错  你不在乎  根本不在乎
Exactly. You don't care. You don't care.

962
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,920
你唯一在乎的就是你那愚蠢的光辉岁月
The only thing you care about are your stupid glory days

963
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,870
当什么绯红机甲  没人想听你说这些
as the Crimson Dynamo, and no one wants to hear about it.

964
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,410
其实是红色守卫
It's the Red Guardian.

965
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:06,790
出去
Get out.

966
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,690
出去
Get out!

967
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:20,080
*我忘记*
*I can't remember*

968
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,640
*我是否流下眼泪*
*If I cried*

969
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:31,680
*当我得知他遗孀的消息*
*When I read about his widowed bride*

970
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:36,950
*但有些事却深深触动了我*
*Something touched me deep inside*

971
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,140
*那日*
*The day*

972
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:42,060
*音乐*
*The music*

973
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:43,800
*已死*
*Died*

974
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,270
*而他们唱着*
*And they were singing*

975
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:50,750
*再见*
*Bye Bye*

976
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:53,290
*美国派小姐*
*Miss American Pie*

977
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,750
*我开着雪佛兰到码头*
*Drove my Chevy to the levee*

978
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:59,550
*但码头已干涸*
*But the levee was dry*

979
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:02,760
*那些好男孩*
*Them good old boys*

980
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:04,640
*一边喝黑麦威士忌*
*Drinking whiskey*

981
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,930
*一边唱*
*Singing*

982
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:11,860
*今天就是我的死期*
*This will be the day that I die*

983
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,420
*今天就是...*
*This'll be the day...*

984
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:36,190
趴下
Get down.

985
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,440
他们以为
They think...

986
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:46,190
对不起
I'm sorry.

987
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,110
别让他等太久了
Let's not keep him waiting.

988
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,890
申请降落许可
Request clearance for landing.

989
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:36,040
{\an2}收到  你可以降落在5号港口

990
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,620
梅丽娜
Melina?

991
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,420
我们一分钟后降落
We're touching down in one minute.

992
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:45,670
那为什么我们还在向上飞
Then why are we still going up?

993
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,760
现在你知道这么多年以来
Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed

994
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,890
德雷科夫是怎么销声匿迹的了
above the radar all these years.

995
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,230
{\an8}红房子

996
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:12,660
我的天
My god.

997
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,110
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

998
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,460
那么
So, uh,

999
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,740
你的家庭团聚如何
how was the family reunion?

1000
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,660
很糟糕
Oh, it was awful.

1001
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,530
他们太黏人了
They were clingy,

1002
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:26,220
情绪化  需求很多
and too emotional, and needy.

1003
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:27,840
就像以前一样  对吧
Just like old times, huh?

1004
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,280
叶莲娜·贝洛娃
Yelena Belova.

1005
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:31,880
她是怎么回事
What's the deal with her?

1006
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,590
她是唯一一个受到影响的  对吧
She was the only one affected, right?

1007
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,480
据我所知  是的
As far as I know, yes.

1008
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:39,980
那些气体和解毒剂
These gasses and antidotes,

1009
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:41,920
让我头疼得很
it's a pain in my ass.

1010
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:46,360
这是个问题  你得去处理好
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

1011
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:47,840
我要是出去了
I have nine pigs

1012
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,870
我的九头猪就没人照顾了
that will require attending to in my absence.

1013
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,840
别管你那些猪了
Don't give a shit about your pigs.

1014
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,900
把她的脑袋切开
Cut her brain out...

1015
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,010
找出她的弱点
Identify the weakness.

1016
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,880
这种死法可不怎么酷
This is a much less cool way to die.

1017
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:25,170
阿列克谢
Alexei.

1018
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:35,860
那罗曼诺夫呢
What about Romanoff?

1019
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,210
她是个叛徒
She's a traitor.

1020
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:42,100
她背叛了她的民族  背叛了她的血统
She turned her back on her people. On her blood.

1021
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:44,460
她本来一无所有
She had nothing.

1022
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:48,790
是我给了她一个家  是我给了她爱
I gave her home. I gave her love.

1023
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,350
你给她注射那个东西
Put that thing in her you do.

1024
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,730
就是那些化学药剂
You know, uh, chemicals.

1025
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:57,650
把她变成你的一头猪
Turn her into one of your pigs.

1026
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,320
你能想象要是我能控制一位复仇者成员
Can you imagine what I could do

1027
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,490
我都能做些什么吗
with an Avenger under my control?

1028
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:05,890
你不打算先和她聊聊吗
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

1029
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:09,860
当你直视着你养大的孩子的双眼时
When you look into the eyes of a child you have raised,

1030
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:13,060
这世上没有任何面具能够隐藏
no mask in the world can hide that.

1031
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,720
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1032
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,440
别激动
Now, now.

1033
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,640
别弄坏了我的新玩具
Don't go breaking my new toy.

1034
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:38,470
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1035
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,110
我救不了我们
I can't save us.

1036
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:45,660
我想让你知道我很抱歉
I need you to know that I'm sorry.

1037
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:47,750
我为了一项事业献出了我的一生
I pledged my life to a cause.

1038
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:49,550
你知道吗  我还以为我很勇敢呢
You know, I thought I was being very brave.

1039
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:51,350
也许是最勇敢的人
Possibly the bravest.

1040
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:53,330
但我一点也不勇敢
But I wasn't being brave.

1041
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:55,870
我是个懦夫
I was coward.

1042
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:02,920
在古巴时
In Cuba,

1043
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,770
当他们过来把你从我身边带走时
when they came and took you away from me...

1044
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,540
没有任何事业都不值得这种结果
No cause is worth that.

1045
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:15,380
你如果要牺牲你自己
You should only sacrifice yourself

1046
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,920
那只能是为了一些
for something...

1047
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,290
你是怎么做到的
How did you do that?

1048
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,300
这些牢房都是我自己设计的
I designed these cells myself.

1049
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:35,760
什么
What?

1050
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:38,310
怎么会
What?

1051
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:42,280
我吐露了真心  结果只有你听到了
I bared my soul to you and it was just you the whole time?

1052
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,720
恐怕是这样  等一下  我在和叶莲娜通话
Yes, I'm afraid so. But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

1053
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:49,080
叶莲娜  是我  是妈妈
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

1054
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,540
你的腰间藏了一把两英寸长的刀
You have a two-inch blade concealed in your beltline.

1055
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,210
什么
What?

1056
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,300
你们要对我做什么
What are you going to do to me?

1057
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,260
右大腿外侧
Outside right hip.

1058
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,710
{\an2}开颅时让她保持清醒

1059
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,050
你就不能早点告诉我吗
You couldn't have told me sooner?

1060
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,400
别生气
Don't throw a fit.

1061
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,140
没时间了
There wasn't time.

1062
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:32,780
好的  姑娘们
Okay, girls,

1063
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,080
我听不清你们说什么
I'm having trouble hearing you,

1064
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,760
但是  娜塔莎  有件事我想告诉你
but, Natasha, there's something I need you to know.

1065
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:42,130
我想告诉你我很抱歉  我不会再为自己开脱了
I need you to know that I'm sorry. No more excuses, okay?

1066
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:45,820
我曾为我的事业献身  我以为我很勇敢
I gave my life for a cause. I thought I was being brave.

1067
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,750
你没有耳机
You don't have earpiece.

1068
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:49,430
什么
What?

1069
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:50,640
是的  她听不见
No, she can't hear you.

1070
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,340
-你没有耳机  -为什么
- You don't have earpiece. - Why not?

1071
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:53,880
因为这不在计划之内
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1072
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,530
是吗  那计划是什么
Oh, yeah? Well, what was the plan?

1073
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:57,080
等我们进去之后
So, once we're inside,

1074
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:59,370
我会激活追踪器  罗斯就会赶过来
I'll activate my tracker and Ross will come running.

1075
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:02,560
你还记得你是个全球通缉犯吧
You are aware that you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1076
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:05,480
我知道那个地方  肯定有办法降落
You know the facility. There must be some way to land it.

1077
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:10,150
命令他们把我们关在零层
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1078
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:13,240
等我出来  我就能启动着陆程序
Once I'm out, I can activate the landing protocol,

1079
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,540
我们可以在一小时内降落
we can descend within the hour.

1080
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:15,810
糟了
Ah, problem.

1081
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,120
我只有一副耳机
I only have one earpiece set.

1082
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:20,930
我来给叶莲娜
I'll give it to Yelena.

1083
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:22,470
他把药瓶带到哪里去了
Where did he take the vials?

1084
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:24,700
可能带去冷藏室了
Probably down to cold storage.

1085
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,860
德雷科夫还控制着寡妇们
Dreykov still has the widows under his control,

1086
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:29,480
所以你得让她们接触到这种解毒剂
so you have to expose them to this antidote.

1087
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,900
好的  小事一桩
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1088
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,170
这就是你的计划吗
Is this your plan?

1089
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,830
我的计划是杀了你
My plan is to kill you.

1090
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,040
我还活着
I'm alive.

1091
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:41,890
那我们现在该怎么办
So, what do we do now?

1092
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,040
我母亲叫什么名字
What was my mother's name?

1093
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:52,890
我们埋葬她的地方
Where we buried her,

1094
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,050
有一棵树
there was a tree...

1095
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:57,520
那里有
Um...

1096
01:33:58,370 --> 01:33:59,960
粉色的花
A pink blossom.

1097
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,420
很美
Beautiful.

1098
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,780
那里有一块墓碑
And there was a tombstone

1099
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:05,690
上面刻着她的名字
with her name engraved on it.

1100
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,990
她叫什么
What was her name?

1101
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:15,100
"无名氏"
"Unknown."

1102
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,330
你什么都感觉不到吗
You don't feel anything?

1103
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,640
我杀你女儿的时候  你有什么感觉吗
You feel anything when I killed your daughter?

1104
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,170
这就是让你困扰的过去吗
Is this your haunted past?

1105
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,090
真的吗
Really?

1106
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:42,720
谢谢你  娜塔莎
Thank you, Natasha.

1107
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:50,060
你给了我最精良的武器
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1108
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,300
打个招呼吧
Say hello.

1109
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:12,600
当你的炸弹爆炸的时候
When your bomb exploded,

1110
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:15,420
差点害死我的安东尼亚
it nearly killed my Antonia.

1111
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:23,200
我不得不在她的后颈植入芯片
I had to put a chip in the back of her neck.

1112
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,610
在她后颈里面
In the back of her neck.

1113
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:26,970
看着她
Look at her.

1114
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:30,820
你觉得不忍直视吗
You find it difficult to look at her?

1115
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:32,640
我觉得
I do.

1116
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:36,600
她  她看着一切
She... She watches everything

1117
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:38,830
她可以做到
and she can do it.

1118
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:41,130
她是个完美的模仿者
She's a perfect mimic.

1119
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:46,220
她和你的朋友们一样都很会打架
And she fights just like all of your friends.

1120
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:52,400
她能听见我说话吗
Can she hear me?

1121
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:56,710
什么
What?

1122
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,090
你想让她好受点吗
You want to make her feel better?

1123
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:05,620
你想跟她说你很抱歉吗
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1124
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:08,650
那你在炸烂她的脸之前
Well, you should have thought of that

1125
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:10,760
就应该想到这些
before you blew her face off.

1126
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:15,340
别胡扯了
But enough of all this bullshit.

1127
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,010
来干活吧
Go to work.

1128
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:20,200
我的地下室里有老鼠  去吧
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1129
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:23,660
快去
Go.

1130
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:37,110
那是个大错
Well, that was a mistake.

1131
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:38,980
什么
Was it?

1132
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,750
你刚刚送走了
You just sent away the one thing

1133
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,440
能救你一命的人
that would stop me from killing you.

1134
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:45,180
试试看
Try, then.

1135
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:46,400
杀了我
Do it.

1136
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:52,650
保险栓开着吗
Is the safety on?

1137
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:58,740
没有
No.

1138
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:03,930
试试用刀
Try your knife.

1139
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:14,930
你有麻烦了
You're in trouble.

1140
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,650
你是怎么控制我的
How are you controlling me?

1141
01:37:16,650 --> 01:37:18,670
我没有控制你  娜塔莎
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1142
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,400
目前还没有
Well, not yet.

1143
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:23,370
但是有一个信息素锁
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1144
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,980
闻到我的信息素
Smelling my pheromones prevents you

1145
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:28,320
会让你停止对我使用暴力
from committing violence against me.

1146
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,960
我对梅丽娜很失望
I'm very upset with Melina.

1147
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:37,370
真可惜  我不得不杀了她
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1148
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:39,680
别这样嘛  如果我们只是
Come on, now. If we're just going to

1149
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,710
按下按钮  黑进电脑
press buttons and hack computers...

1150
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:42,690
-是啊  -我是说  我不知道
- yes. - I mean, I don't know.

1151
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:43,950
我什么都做不了
There's nothing for me to do.

1152
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:47,140
我想  我想砸点东西
I want to... I want to break something.

1153
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:48,260
是吗
Oh, you do?

1154
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,230
这儿有你可以砸的东西了
Oh, there is something you can break.

1155
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:10,390
梅丽娜  如果这是我们最后一次
Melina, if this is the last time that we...

1156
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:13,780
该死
damn it.

1157
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:28,330
太恶心了
That was disgusting.

1158
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:42,900
好吧
Okay.

1159
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:04,410
{\an8}启动降落序列

1160
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:07,110
所以这就是你的伟大计划吗
So, this was the big plan, huh?

1161
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:10,240
梅丽娜打算把红屋子降到地上
Melina was going to land the Red Room

1162
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,740
然后把我交给当局
and hand me over to the authorities.

1163
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,830
不  不
Oh, no, no, no.

1164
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:18,860
{\an8}降落序列中止

1165
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,190
{\an8}所有系统在线

1166
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:24,100
那现在要怎么样  也要把我
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into

1167
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,990
弄成你那些可悲傀儡吗
your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1168
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,630
可悲
Pathetic, huh?

1169
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:29,030
是啊  你想怎么称呼
Yeah, what would you call it?

1170
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:30,910
-我会说  -你上一次和一个 
- I would call it... - When was the last time

1171
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:32,500
不是被动强迫和你交流的
that you had a conversation with somebody

1172
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,180
真人聊天是什么时候了
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1173
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:37,340
你逃离这里  加入了错误的战场
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1174
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:41,340
真正的战争在这里  在暗处
The real war was fought here, in the shadows.

1175
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,770
你没有在暗处作战
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1176
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,520
你只是躲在黑暗
You hid in the dark.

1177
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:48,440
真正的力量源自于潜移默化的影响
Real power comes from undetectable influence.

1178
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:50,520
如果没人可以注意到  那有什么存在的意义
If no one's noticed, then why even do it?

1179
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:52,470
你一无是处
You're nothing.

1180
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,330
也一无所有
You have nothing.

1181
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:57,330
这星球上有50个人
There are 50 people on this planet...

1182
01:39:57,570 --> 01:39:58,270
闭嘴吧
Oh, stop it.

1183
01:39:58,270 --> 01:40:01,430
不准命令我闭嘴
Don't tell me to stop!

1184
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:02,710
如果我不在你该闭嘴的的时候告诉你
If I don't tell you when to stop,

1185
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:04,250
那你怎么知道什么时候该闭嘴
then how will you know when to shut up?

1186
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,060
拜托
Come on.

1187
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,890
以为我挨不了一拳吗
Think I can't take a punch?

1188
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:17,440
-真见鬼  你太弱了  -弱
- God damn it, you're weak. - Weak?

1189
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:18,830
我敢说在一群手无寸铁的小姑娘面前
I bet it's easier to be tough

1190
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:20,390
装强硬更容易吧
in front of defenseless little girls, huh?

1191
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,430
够了
That's enough.

1192
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,150
如果你真的了解
You wouldn't be so glib

1193
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:37,270
我建造之一切的意义  你就不会这么油嘴滑舌了
if you had any notion of the scope of what I've built.

1194
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:41,240
我掌控这个世界  是我
I own this world. Me.

1195
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:42,990
你似乎不顾一切地要向我证明你自己
You seem desperate to impress me.

1196
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:44,490
我不需要向你证明
I don't need to impress you.

1197
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:46,890
我不需要向任何人证明
I don't need to impress anyone.

1198
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:51,730
这些国家的领导  这些伟人
These world leaders, these great men,

1199
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:55,950
他们听令于我和我的寡妇
they answer to me and my widows.

1200
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:58,460
{\an8}正在登陆

1201
01:40:58,690 --> 01:40:59,460
{\an8}权限已验证

1202
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:00,270
看看他们
Look at them.

1203
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,780
这些女孩都是垃圾
These girls were trash.

1204
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,240
她们被丢在街上
They are thrown out into the street.

1205
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,460
我只不过是回收她们
I recycle the trash.

1206
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:13,400
赋予她们使命
And I give them purpose.

1207
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,330
给了她们生命
I give them a life.

1208
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:26,750
梅丽娜  我找到解毒剂了
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1209
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:29,930
我遇到点小麻烦
I've had a slight setback.

1210
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:34,070
你得去找那些寡妇们了
You'll need to get to the widows.

1211
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:55,130
我的寡妇关系网络
It's my network of widows

1212
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:57,720
帮助我制衡权力的天平
that help me control the scales of power.

1213
01:41:58,670 --> 01:42:02,260
一声令下  石油和股市就会崩塌
One command, the oil and stock markets crumble.

1214
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:06,580
一声令下  地球四分之一的人就会挨饿
One command,and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1215
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:10,350
我的寡妇们可以发动和终结战争
My widows can start and end wars.

1216
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:13,300
她们可以成就或摧毁国王
They can make and break kings.

1217
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:19,170
你在这里就可以控制这一切吗
You control all of that from here?

1218
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:22,040
有了你
And with you,

1219
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,390
复仇者也会在我的控制之中
an Avenger under my control,

1220
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,390
我终于可以走出阴影了
I can finally come out of the shadows

1221
01:42:31,170 --> 01:42:35,900
使用这世上多余的资源
using the only natural resource that the world has too much of.

1222
01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:38,510
女孩们
Girls.

1223
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,270
都通过那个小控制台来实现吗
All from that little console?

1224
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:53,210
对
yeah.

1225
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:59,710
你觉得这很好笑吗
Oh, you find this amusing?

1226
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:01,340
为什么你在笑
Why are you smiling?

1227
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:03,710
不是针对你  但
Don't take it personal, but, uh...

1228
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:08,070
谢谢你的配合
Thank you for your cooperation.

1229
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:13,090
即使你找到了数据库逼迫他交出密钥
Even if you locate the database and get him to show you the key,

1230
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:15,350
你也无法从他那带走它
you won't be able to take it from him.

1231
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:19,810
多年来  德雷科夫一直在使用信息素
For years, Dreykov has implemented a pheromonal lock

1232
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:21,590
控制所有寡妇  包括我
in all widows, even me.

1233
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,910
那么  只要我们能闻到他的气味
So, as long as we can smell him,

1234
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:26,300
我们就无法伤害他
then we won't be able to hurt him.

1235
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,170
好吧  那我会屏住呼吸
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1236
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:29,190
还不够
Not enough.

1237
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,560
从科学角度说
This is basic science.

1238
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:35,060
娜塔莎  你必须切断神经
Natasha, to block receptors in olfactory center,

1239
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:36,700
才能阻断嗅觉中心的感受器
you have to sever the nerve.

1240
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:40,180
我能处理好的
I can handle that.

1241
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:43,160
你不够强大  所以
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1242
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,370
我得自己解决这一切
I'll have to finish it myself.

1243
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,350
你打算干什么
What are you going to do?

1244
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:51,870
切断神经
Sever the nerve.

1245
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,610
{\an2}她手里有枪

1246
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:15,750
梅丽娜
Melina!

1247
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:22,390
{\an2}梅丽娜  站住

1248
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:27,590
{\an2}放下武器

1249
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:29,330
正合我意
Precisely what I was thinking.

1250
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:43,930
叶莲娜  计划稍有改变
Yelena,slight change of plan.

1251
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:45,800
我彻底摧毁了其中一个引擎
I completely demolished one of the engines

1252
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,620
我们将进行可控坠毁
and we are going into a controlled crash.

1253
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:51,370

现在没话了  是吗
Not so talkative now, are you?

1258
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:45,730
你夺走了我的童年

1259
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:49,510
夺走了我的选择权  试图毁了我

1260
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,200

1261
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:02,690

1262

她死之前  谁也不能离开这房间

1263
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:08,660

我不想伤害你们

看起来很疼啊
That looks like it hurts.

1268

1270
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:21,720

离这里越远越好
Get as far away from here as possible.

1272
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,990
接下来你们要自己选择了
You get to make your own choices now.

1273
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:40,960
我们得离开这
We gotta get outta here.

1274
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,460
我们要去找德雷科夫  你来吗
We need to find Dreykov. Are you coming?

1275
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,360
我跟你去
I'm right behind you.

1276
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:52,650
等等  等一下  我得回去
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

你看到孩子们了吗
Do you see the girls?

1282
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:37,700
没有
No!

1283
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:11,390
我们得回去
We need to go back.

1284
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:40,330
我们失控了
We've lost control.

1285
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:05,990
安东尼亚
Antonia.

1286
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:14,310
我要是打开这扇门

你就会追着我不放
You're gonna come after me.

1288
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:18,970
没事  没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

1289
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,020
我知道你的意识还在

1290
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:28,050
我也不会把你扔在这  好吗
And I'm not gonna leave you. Okay.

1291
01:53:42,850 --> 01:53:43,970
叶莲娜
Yelena!

1292
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:46,600
她在机翼上
She's on the wing!

1293
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:48,990
快  你们在等什么
Move! What are you waiting for?

1294
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:52,110
别这么做
Don't do it!

1295
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:54,420
很好玩
This was fun!

1296

够了
Enough.

1300
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:58,220
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1301
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,680
他死了吗
Is he gone?

1302
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,980
他死了
He's gone.

1303
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:27,990
叶莲娜
Yelena!

1304
01:57:39,110 --> 01:57:40,080
叶莲娜
Yelena?

1305
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:48,670
我们俩都在下腰
We're both upside down.

1306
01:57:57,830 --> 01:58:01,990
{\an2}原谅我  我的妹妹

1307
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:05,600
我应该回来找你的
I should've come back for you.

1308
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:06,660
你不用说这些
You don't have to say that.

1309
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:07,470
没关系
It's okay.

1310
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:09,980
这个家对我来说也是真的
It was real to me, too.

1311
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:25,870
谢谢你
Thank you.

1312
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:41,930
大家都没事吧
Everybody good?

1313
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,580
我明显受伤了
I am clearly injured.

1314
01:58:45,710 --> 01:58:46,780
你想说什么吗
You got something to say?

1315
01:58:48,710 --> 01:58:50,110
我说出来只会搞砸局面
I'd just mess it up.

1316
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:05,780
装甲部队来了
Here comes the cavalry.

1317
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:10,830
我们正在接近目标  长官
We're closing in on the target, sir.

1318
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,790
下一步什么打算
So, what's our plan?

1319
01:59:17,430 --> 01:59:20,010
你们走吧  我留下
You guys go. I'll stay.

1320
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:22,340
你疯了吗  我们要战斗  我们和你一起战斗
That's insanity. We fight. We fight with you.

1321
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:23,310
-我来拦住他们  -娜塔莎  我们一起战斗
- I'll hold them off. - Natasha, we fight.

1322
01:59:23,310 --> 01:59:25,750
我们不能分头行动  你也太固执了
We can't split up. You're so pigheaded.

1323
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,000
-你们大家  快走  -我的老天
- You guys, go. - Oh, my God.

1324
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,430
而且  如果我们四个能和解
Besides, if it can work out with the four of us, you know,

1325
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:32,310
那复仇者们也许也有希望和好
there may be some hope for the Avengers.

1326
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:34,650
有那么点可能
Little bit.

1327
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:38,590
好吧  如果你要走  那我觉得这个应该给你
Okay, well, if you're leaving, then I guess you should take this.

1328
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:41,180
我知道你有多喜欢它
I know how much you like it.

1329
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:43,190

梅丽娜需要复制配方
Melina will need to copy the formula,

1334
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:54,810
但应该是你去告诉她们  都结束了
but you should be the one to tell 'em it's over.

1335
02:00:14,690 --> 02:00:16,090
你们回来救我们了
You came back for us.

1336
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:18,550

你怎么总是在睡觉

1344
02:02:32,610 --> 02:02:34,100
就因为你  我在三天里

那你用破零件拼出什么来了吗

这次给我弄了些什么  倒着用的割草机吗
What'd you get me this time, like, an upside-down lawnmower?

1349

看吧  给我时间和钱  就能给你弄到好东西
You see what I can get you with a bit of time and money?

1350
02:02:57,310 --> 02:02:59,000
拜托  说出来  我要听
Go on, say it. I wanna hear it.

1351
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,820

1357
02:03:15,310 --> 02:03:17,810
有意思的是  我一直没觉得自己有家
It's funny. My whole life, I didn't think I had any family.

1358
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,880
结果发现我居然有两个  所以...
Turns out I got two, so...

1359
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:22,270
其中一个现在有点乱套
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

1360
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:24,650
我得帮他们中的几个越个狱
I'm gonna go break a few of them out of prison

这个女人做的事
What this woman did,

1368
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:49,880
说实话  我真的难以想象
honestly, I can't even imagine.

1369
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:52,550
你本不应该
You're not supposed to be bothering me

1370
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:54,460
在我休假的时候打扰我  瓦伦蒂娜
on my holiday time, Valentina.

1371
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,170

I'm just here paying my respects.

1373
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,440
你都来这里了  看起来没招了
You know, coming here makes you look desperate.

1374
02:13:05,910 --> 02:13:06,930
好吧
Okay.

1375

1379
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:17,860
觉得应该当面告诉你
Thought I'd hand-deliver it.

1380
02:13:19,930 --> 02:13:21,840
也许你想挑战一下
Maybe you'd like a shot at the man

1381
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:25,130
害死你姐姐的人

1382
02:13:27,690 --> 02:13:29,570
长得挺可爱  你不觉得吗
Kind of a cutie, don't you think?
